excerpt: "The novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has impacted our societies on an unprecedented scale. Worldwide, lockdowns and quarantines have been implemented to contain the spread of the virus, and are currently in place for more than 50% of the global population. These restrictive physical distancing measures raise many concerns regarding their adverse impact on our societies, economies, and health-care systems."
