Hi! I’m David, a Senior Research Fellow at the University of Geneva, 
Switzerland in the [Faculty of Medicine](https://www.unige.ch/medecine/) 
and the [GIRAPH group](https://www.giraph.org/). 
I am also a visiting research fellow at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lgb/geome/) 
and am affiliatied with the Geneva University Hospitals through 
the [Unit of Population Epidemiology](https://www.hug.ch/medecine-premier-recours/uep).
I’m a spatial data scientist by training with a background in bioengineering.
My research and interests are all grounded in the idea that most things, 
from proteins in a cell to human beings in a community, are connected. This perspective 
motivates my conviction that holistic, big picture approaches are beneficial, acknowledging
that the whole is indeed greater than the sum of its parts. These approaches 
offer opportunities in many fields through the power of spatial analyses
and network science.

### Main fields of interest
**Precision Public Health, Spatial Epidemiology, Digital Health, Health Systems, Data-driven Decision-making**

### Main Skills
**Data science, Geospatial Analysis, GIS, Causal inference, Machine Learning, Remote Sensing**
## Work and research
In my work, I harness quantitative and computational methodologies to deeply understand
the spatial dynamics of public health. With a focus on spatial data analysis,
I've engaged with many disciplines. My prior endeavors range from leveraging large
Swiss health insurance data to unpack the cost-effectiveness of traditional and
alternative medicine using causal inference techniques, to scrutinizing the
epidemiological impacts of air pollution through a detailed spatial lens using
remote sensing and machine learning models. I've also explored the vast potential
of geospatial clustering in public health using diverse spatial statistics, leading
to targeted interventions and enhanced surveillance practices. By navigating the
complexities of health-related data, including diet-associated risk factors, breast cancer screening participation
and COVID-19 response strategies, my research has fostered a more nuanced
understanding of healthcare delivery and outcomes. My commitment to these areas is
underpinned by the belief that robust, data-driven insights are essential for the
evolution of public health and the well-being of communities.

Through my roles at the University of Geneva and EPFL I have also had the chance to consult
with various organisations about a wide range of topics which gave me experience in
understanding needs, tailoring approaches, and creating value. I have also consolidated my ability to rigorously manage deadlines and budgets while sharpening my communication skills to share complex results accurately and convincingly, both in writing and orally.


## Background and history
I received my Ph.D in Life Sciences from the [University of Geneva](https://lifesciencesphd.unige.ch/), my M.Eng. in Bioengineering from [Gembloux Agro-Bio Tech](https://www.gembloux.uliege.be/cms/c_4039827/en/gembloux-agro-bio-tech) the bioengineering faculty at the University of Liège, and my B.Eng. in [the bioengineering faculty](https://www.ulb.be/en/programme/ba-irbi-1) at the Université Libre de Bruxelles. I conducted my Master Thesis at the [Center for Cancer Systems Biology](https://ccsb.dana-farber.org/) (CCSB) at the [Dana Farber Cancer Institute - Harvard Medical School](https://www.dana-farber.org/). For just under two years after receiving my master, I was at the CCSB as a staff bioinformatician. After receiving my PhD in Life Sciences, I was a postdoctoral scholar at the University of Geneva then became a senior research fellow and led several research and education efforts.

## Work philosophy
I’m a curious and enjoy integrating disciplines like data science, epidemiology, digital health and spatial science with fields like genetics, microbiology and virology. I am also very result oriented and love working on applied projects providing actionable insights. I enjoy collaborating with people and teams from many disciplines and find it extremely rewarding to learn from different perspectives. I also frequently talk and teach at events, conferences and MAS, CAS and workshops.
