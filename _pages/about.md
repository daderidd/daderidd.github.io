Hi! I’m David, a Senior Research Fellow at the University of Geneva, 
Switzerland in the [Faculty of Medicine](https://www.unige.ch/medecine/) 
and the [GIRAPH group](https://www.giraph.org/). 
I am also a visiting research fellow at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lgb/geome/) 
and am affiliatied with the Geneva University Hospitals through 
the [Unit of Population Epidemiology](https://www.hug.ch/medecine-premier-recours/uep).
I’m a spatial data scientist by training with a background in bioengineering, 
but I have just enough expertise in computer science and data science to make trouble.
My research and interests are all grounded in the idea that most things, 
from proteins in a cell to human beings in a community, are connected. This perspective 
motivates my belief of the benefits of big picture/holistic approaches that recognize
that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.



## My work and research
In my work, I harness quantitative and computational methodologies to deeply understand the spatial dynamics of public health. With a focus on spatial data analysis, I've engaged with many disciplines, bringing the precision of life sciences to the more fluid realm of digital epidemiology. My prior endeavors range from leveraging large Swiss health insurance data to unpack the cost-effectiveness of traditional and alternative medicine using causal inference techniques, to scrutinizing the epidemiological impacts of air pollution through a detailed spatial lens using remote sensing and machine learning models. I've also explored the vast potential of geospatial clustering in public health using diverse spatial statistics, leading to targeted interventions and enhanced surveillance practices. By navigating the complexities of health-related data, including participation in breast cancer screening programs and COVID-19 response strategies, my research has fostered a more nuanced understanding of healthcare delivery and outcomes. My commitment to these areas is underpinned by the belief that robust, data-driven insights are essential for the evolution of public health and the well-being of communities.


## My background and history
I received my Ph.D in Life Sciences from the [University of Geneva](https://lifesciencesphd.unige.ch/), my M.Eng. in Bioengineering from [Gembloux Agro-Bio Tech](https://www.gembloux.uliege.be/cms/c_4039827/en/gembloux-agro-bio-tech) the bioengineering faculty at the University of Liège, and my B.Eng. in [the bioengineering faculty](https://www.ulb.be/en/programme/ba-irbi-1) at the Université Libre de Bruxelles. I conducted my Master Thesis at the [Center for Cancer Systems Biology](https://ccsb.dana-farber.org/) (CCSB) at the [Dana Farber Cancer Institute - Harvard Medical School](https://www.dana-farber.org/). For just under two years after receiving my master, I was at the CCSB as a staff bioinformatician. After receiving my PhD in Life Sciences, I was a postdoctoral scholar at the University of Geneva then became a senior research fellow and led several research and education efforts.

## My intellectual interests
I’m a curious and enjoy integrating disciplines like data science, epidemiology, digital health and spatial science with fields like genetics, microbiology and virology. I am also very result oriented and love working on applied projects providing actionable insights. Methodologically, I am trained both as spatial data scientist and a bioengineer with a strong background in genetics, bioinformatics and statistics. I enjoy collaborating with people and teams from many disciplines and find it extremely rewarding to learn from different perspectives. I also frequently talk and teach at events, conferences and MAS, CAS and workshops. Through my roles at the University of Geneva and EPFL I have had the chance to consult with various organisations about a wide range of topics.
