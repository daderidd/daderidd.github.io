Hi! I’m David, a Senior Research Fellow at the University of Geneva, 
Switzerland in the [Faculty of Medicine](https://www.unige.ch/medecine/) 
and the [GIRAPH group](https://www.giraph.org/). I am also a visiting research fellow at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lgb/geome/) 
and am affiliated with the Geneva University Hospitals through 
the [Unit of Population Epidemiology](https://www.hug.ch/medecine-premier-recours/uep).

**I will be on the job market for industry, research and humanitarian roles in early 2024!**

As a spatial data scientist with a bioengineering background, I view the world through
the lens of interconnectedness — from proteins to human communities. This
perspective fuels my belief in the power of holistic, big-picture approaches,
recognizing that collective elements often yield greater impact than their individual
parts. My experience in spatial analysis and network science unlocks potential across
various fields. Eager to transition from academia to industry or humanitarian roles,
I aim to leverage my skills to address real-world challenges, devising impactful
strategies in diverse sectors. I am particularly attracted to roles offering varied
challenges and opportunities to effect meaningful change.

### Main fields of interest
Precision Public Health — Spatial Epidemiology — Digital Health — Health Systems — Climate Change — Data-driven Decision-making

### Main Skills
Data science — Project Management — Statistics — Fundraising — GIS — Public Speaking — Causal Inference — Machine Learning — Remote Sensing

## Work and research
In my work, I harness quantitative and computational methodologies to deeply understand
the spatial dynamics of public health. With a focus on spatial data analysis,
I've engaged with many disciplines. My prior endeavors range from leveraging large
Swiss health insurance data to unpack the cost-effectiveness of traditional and
alternative medicine using causal inference techniques, to scrutinizing the
epidemiological impacts of air pollution through a detailed spatial lens using
remote sensing and machine learning models. I've also explored the vast potential
of geospatial clustering in public health using diverse spatial statistics, leading
to targeted interventions and enhanced surveillance practices. By navigating the
complexities of health-related data, including diet-associated risk factors, breast cancer screening participation
and COVID-19 response strategies, my research has fostered a more nuanced
understanding of healthcare delivery and outcomes. My commitment to these areas is
underpinned by the belief that robust, data-driven insights are essential for the
evolution of public health and the well-being of communities.

Through my roles at the University of Geneva and EPFL I have also had the chance to consult
with various organisations about a wide range of topics which gave me experience in
understanding needs, tailoring approaches, and creating value. I have also
consolidated my ability to rigorously manage deadlines and budgets while sharpening
my communication skills to share complex results accurately and convincingly, both
in writing and orally. Here is a selection of consulting projects I have carried out to completion:

- Successfully identified high-risk populations (vulnerable and poorly vaccinated) in the canton of Geneva to enable the Direction Générale de la Santé (DGS) to optimize the canton's vaccination strategy during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.
- In a project with the Fondation genevoise pour le dépistage du cancer,  I identified disparities in screening participation and provided insights into the determinants of participation, enabling a reassessment of their future communications and recruitment methods.
- Spearheaded a consulting project analyzing citizen subsidies in the canton of Vaud, Switzerland, including identifying the distribution of
recipients, assessing regional disparities in utilization, and creating scenarios to optimize social service
center locations.
- Conducted a comprehensive territorial health diagnosis for the commune of Plan-les-Ouates (Geneva, CH), delivering a prioritized list of healthcare services for inclusion in the planning of a future healthcare center, strategically aligning with demographic trends to anticipate community needs.



## Background and history
I received my Ph.D in Life Sciences from the [University of Geneva](https://lifesciencesphd.unige.ch/), my M.Eng. in Bioengineering from [Gembloux Agro-Bio Tech](https://www.gembloux.uliege.be/cms/c_4039827/en/gembloux-agro-bio-tech) the bioengineering faculty at the University of Liège, and my B.Eng. in [the bioengineering faculty](https://www.ulb.be/en/programme/ba-irbi-1) at the Université Libre de Bruxelles. I conducted my Master Thesis at the [Center for Cancer Systems Biology](https://ccsb.dana-farber.org/) (CCSB) at the [Dana Farber Cancer Institute - Harvard Medical School](https://www.dana-farber.org/). For just under two years after receiving my master, I was at the CCSB as a staff bioinformatician. After receiving my PhD in Life Sciences, I was a postdoctoral scholar at the University of Geneva then became a senior research fellow and led several research and education efforts.

## Work philosophy
I’m a curious and enjoy integrating disciplines like data science, epidemiology, digital health and spatial science with fields like genetics, microbiology and virology. I am also very result oriented and love working on applied projects providing actionable insights. I enjoy collaborating with people and teams from many disciplines and find it extremely rewarding to learn from different perspectives. I also frequently talk and teach at events, conferences and MAS, CAS and workshops.
