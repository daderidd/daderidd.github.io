Hi! I’m David, a Senior Research Fellow at the University of Geneva, Switzerland in the [Faculty of Medicine](https://www.unige.ch/medecine/) and the [GIRAPH group](https://www.giraph.org/). I am a visiting research fellow at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lgb/geome/) and also maintain an affiliation with the Geneva University Hospitals through the [Unit of Population Epidemiology](https://www.hug.ch/medecine-premier-recours/uep). I’m a spatial data scientist by training with a background in bioengineering, but I have just enough expertise in computer science and data science to make trouble. My research, teaching, and broader service are all grounded in the idea that science and technology are inherently social activities, which are directed, operated, and maintained in certain ways (and not in other ways), by people in and outside of institutions.

## My work and research
I use quantitative, and computational methods to holistically investigate systems of technology and knowledge production. I have a particular focus on decentralized communities and institutions, such as open source software, scientific research, peer production platforms (like Wikipedia), and social media sites. Most of my previous work has focused on [Wikipedia](http://enwp.org/Wikipedia), where I've studied the people and algorithms that produce and maintain an open encyclopedia. I’ve also studied scientific research networks and projects, including the [Long-Term Ecological Research Network](https://lternet.edu/), the [Open Science Grid](https://www.opensciencegrid.org/), and the [Moore-Sloan Data Science Environments](http://msdse.org/). I study topics including newcomer socialization, cooperation and conflict, community governance, specialization and professionalization, information verification and quality control, hackathons and community workshops, the roles of support staff and technicians, bias and discrimination, and diversity and inclusion. I also often focus on how these issues all intersect with and are embedded in the design of software and automated systems.

## My background and history
I received my Ph.D from the [University of Geneva](https://lifesciencesphd.unige.ch/), my M.Eng. from [Gembloux Agro-Bio Tech](https://www.gembloux.uliege.be/cms/c_4039827/en/gembloux-agro-bio-tech) the bioengineering faculty at the University of Liège, and my B.Eng. in [the bioengineering faculty](https://www.ulb.be/en/programme/ba-irbi-1) at the Université Libre de Bruxelles. I conducted my Master Thesis at the [Center for Cancer Systems Biology](https://ccsb.dana-farber.org/) (CCSB) at the [Dana Farber Cancer Institute - Harvard Medical School](https://www.dana-farber.org/). For just under two years after receiving my master, I was at the CCSB as a staff bioinformatician. After receiving my PhD in Life Sciences, I was a postdoctoral scholar at the University of Geneva then became a senior research fellow and led several research and education efforts.

## My intellectual interests
I’m a curious and interdisciplinary, I love integrating disciplines like data science, epidemiology, digital health and spatial science with fields like genetics, microbiology and virology. I am also very result oriented and love working on applied projects providing actionable insights. Methodologically, I am trained both as spatial data scientist and a bioengineer with a strong background in genetics, bioinformatics and statistics. I enjoy collaborating with people and teams from many disciplines and find it extremely rewarding to learn from different perspectives. I also frequently talk and teach at events, conferences and MAS, CAS and workshops. Through my roles at the University of Geneva and EPFL I have had the chance to consult with various organisations about a wide range of topics.
